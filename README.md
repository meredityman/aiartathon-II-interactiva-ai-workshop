# Building interactive installations and applications with AI and OpenFrameworks

This workshop explores the challenges of using machine learning models for interactive installations, hardware projects and live experiments. We will examine the trade-offs between frameworks, languages and hardware and the specific challenges of connecting ML systems with generative graphics and user input. Finally we will see one example using sockets to communicate between a Tensorflow runtime and OpenFrameworks.

## Summary


### Notes


* Interactive AI for applications and performances.
    * Use of AI should be as a tool that gives greater affordances to artists.
    * These tools should be easily prototypable and work in realtime.
* Neural Networks and Hardware
